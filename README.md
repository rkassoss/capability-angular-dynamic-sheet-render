# Dynamic Sheet Renderer

The example is about embedded Qlik visualizations (charts, maps, tables, etc.) using the Capability APIs without having to load 
the whole Qlik client and the whole sheet every single time.

This approach will allow you to have more control over what you want to show and to display only what your users would need to see.

This example was developed in Angular 15
